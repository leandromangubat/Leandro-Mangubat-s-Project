# Challenge 2

## Purpose
The purpose of this webpage is to display all the lessons learned through html/css and using them for practice

## Usage
The nav bar above the header can be used to directly navigate the user to the desired content

In the "My Content" section, there are five links. The top and top right buttons will lead to my previous work before this challenge. The rest of the buttons will link the user to games and guides that I've used to practice my skills in html/css.
